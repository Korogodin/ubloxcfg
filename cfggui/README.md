# cfggui

## Overview

This is a *very experimental* GUI for controlling u-blox 9 (and perhaps later ones) positioning receivers, analysing
data, recording and replaying logs.

## Building

This needs Linux. It won't work on Windoze. We need gcc (>= 8.0, maybe >= 10.0) and GNU libc.
A recent Ubuntu (20.04 or later) should work.

Install dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libglfw3-dev libfreetype6-dev libglu1-mesa-dev zlib1g-dev libglm-dev gcc g++ # or libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

Build:

```sh
make cfggui -j8
```

On older Ubuntus you may be able to get it to work as follows:

```sh
sudo apt install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libglfw3-dev libfreetype6-dev libglu1-mesa-dev zlib1g-dev libglm-dev gcc-8 g++-8 # or libcurl4-openssl-dev
make cfggui CC=gcc-8 CXX=gcc-8
```

If it fails at compiler warnings, try disabling them (remove `-Werror` from Makefile).

YMMV.

Debugging gui: `LIBGL_SHOW_FPS=1 LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose ./output/cfggui-release` (<https://docs.mesa3d.org/envvars.html>)

## TODOs, ideas

* Implement Logfile::Read(), Seek(), Tell(), Size(), and gzipped read/write/seek/tell/size
* Navigation status page (same stuff as in input window + velocity gage, artificial horizon, etc.)?
* Implement A-GNSS
* Add epoch rate [Hz] to nav status (also for logfile!)
* Messages data win: show tree anyway if hidden but selected message not present (until it is present...)
* Clear all settings (on next restart) option
* Custom message: implement RTCM3
* Custom message: load from / save to file, load from clipboard? sw itch to right tab depending on what message it is?
* Fix docking troubles in GuiWinInput::DrawWindow(), disallow some centre dockings
* Improve GuiWinDataPlot, e.g. markers, lines, lines+markers, ...
* Handle database reset (insert blank epoch?) when seeking in logfile
* File dialog: load dir entries async, and as needed (make _RefreshDir() run in background)
* (started) Implement epoch info page (table with all details / fields of EPOCH_t etc.)
* FIXMEs and TODOs all over...
* Application crashes if (e.g. receiver) thread  is running on close. Explicitly calling _receiver->Stop() in
  GuiWinInputReceiver::~GuiWinInputReceiver(). Maybe this is now fixed with the GuiSettings rework.
  seems to help (and in ~GuiWinInputLogfile)
* GuiWinDataConfig needs some love, and the new tables..
* Gzipped read: maybe replace by gunzipping file into cache dir and then use that?
  Hmmm... lots of implications with the "immediate" in imgui.. :-/
  Can we implement seekpos()? Maybe re-open file at a certain position? And gzseek() is commented-out in zlib.h anyway... (?!)
* Fix memory leaks... valgrind isn't too happy.. :-/ (Is it?)
* Use Ff::Thread in GuiWinPlay
* Write parser for swisstopo wmts capabilities xml to generate mapparams
* Use https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/raymath.h instead of glm (1 file vs 1000000 files)
* example_emscripten_wgpu, can we do that?
* plot trajectory with error estimates
* OpenGL::SaveState()/RervertState() or something like that
* Something's wrong when stepping logs by epoch: UBX-NAV-EOE is not shown?!
